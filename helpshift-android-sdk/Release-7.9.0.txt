	* Hyperlinks are broken in Action card, agent message and user message.

* Fixed a bug in which image attachment was getting pixelated on the preview screen while attaching an image.
* Fixed a crash with [embeddable fragments](https://developers.helpshift.com/android/support-tools/#embeddable-fragments) that would occur when user launches the app from recents menu after the Android System has already killed it.
